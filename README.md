# Codes
Implementations of several codes for error detection and correction in network transmissions.

Includes implementations of:
1. Hamming Codes (1-error correcting)
2. Hadamard Codes (both Sylvester and Paley constructions)
3. BCH Codes (over extensions of the binary field)

TODO:
1. Add Documentation
2. Implement error correction in BCH codes
